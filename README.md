### 🎯 Objective  
The primary purpose of this simulation software is to train third-party contractors working with Southern California Edison (SCE) in a controlled, interactive virtual reality environment.   By allowing users to train in realistic scenarios, the program reduces risks, standardizes operational procedures, and improves understanding of safety practices.

### 🏆 Project Goals & Importance  

- **Addressing Gaps in Training**  
  Many SCE contractors face difficulties with consistent training practices. This simulation ensures all teams receive standardized instruction.

- **Enhanced Learning**  
  The use of immersive VR environments enhances learning effectiveness, safety awareness, and preparedness through hands-on learning.

- **Cost-Effective & Scalable**  
  Unlike traditional training, this simulation offers a reusable, scalable solution that reduces logistical and physical training constraints.
