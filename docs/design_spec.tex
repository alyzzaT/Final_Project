\section*{Overview}
This document outlines the technical specifications for a Virtual Reality training tool developed for Southern California Edison.

\section*{Frontend}
The frontend is built with a simple HTML interface served by NGINX inside a Docker container. It connects to the backend API.

\section*{Backend}
The backend uses Python with Flask to serve RESTful endpoints. It handles logic for VR simulation data and is containerized with Docker.

\section*{Deployment}
We use Docker Compose to manage both the frontend and backend containers. The app runs locally on ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend).
