\subsection{Test Case \#1}
\textbf{Name:} 3D Models Creation (Trees, Houses, Sidewalks)\\
\textbf{Type:} Functional \\
\textbf{Priority:} Medium \\
\textbf{Estimated Time:} 10 minutes \\
\textbf{Actual Time:} 8 minutes \\
\textbf{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Unity project is opened and active. 
\item The scene with 3D models (e.g., BackyardScene) is loaded.
\item Models for trees, houses, and sidewalks are already imported and placed in the scene. 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Test Steps and Expected Results:} \\

\textbf{Step} & \textbf{Action} & \textbf{Expected Result} & \textbf{Actual Result} \\
\midrule
1 & Open Unity Hub and select the Unity project containing the scene (e.g., "BackyardScene"). & The Unity project should open without any issues, and the relevant scene should load successfully, showing no errors. & The Unity project opened without any issues, and the relevant scene loaded successfully, showing no errors. \\
2 & In the Unity editor, locate the "Scene" tab and load the scene containing the 3D models, such as "BackyardScene." & The scene should load and display without any issues or error messages. & The scene loaded and displayed without any issues or error messages. \\
3 & In the Scene view, navigate to where the 3D models (trees, houses, sidewalks) are located. & The 3D models (trees, houses, sidewalks) should appear clearly and be visible in the scene. & The 3D models (trees, houses, sidewalks) appeared clearly and were visible in the scene. \\
4 & Observe the scale and placement of the models within the scene. & The models should be positioned on the ground, not floating or misaligned, and should have appropriate scale in relation to one another. & The models were positioned on the ground, not floating or misaligned, and had appropriate scale in relation to one another. \\

\subsection{Test Case \#2}
\textbf{Name:} 3D Model Accuracy (Polemaster, Smart Navigator) \\
\textbf{Type:} Functional \\
\textbf{Priority:} High \\
\textbf{Estimated Time:} 5 minutes \\
\textbf{Actual Time:} 5 minutes \\
\textbf{Preconditions:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Unity project with the Polemaster and Smart Navigator models is open.
\item The scene containing the Polemaster and Smart Navigator models is loaded.
\item All necessary assets and materials for the models are available and properly applied.

\midrule
1 & Open Unity Hub and load the Unity project containing the scene with the Polemaster and Smart Navigator models. & The Unity project should open without any issues, and the correct scene should load. & The Unity project opened without any issues, and the correct scene loaded in. \\
2 & In the Unity editor, locate the "Scene" tab and ensure the scene with the Polemaster and Smart Navigator models is loaded. & The scene should load correctly, displaying the models in the editor with no errors or missing assets. & The scene loaded correctly, displayed the models in the editor with no errors or missing assets. \\
3 & In the Scene view, locate and select the Polemaster model. & The Polemaster model should be clearly visible, with the correct shape and details such as wires and LED indicators. & The Polemaster model was visible, but some details were incorrect; specifically, the wire colors did not match the expected appearance. \\
4 & Observe the Polemaster model to ensure the materials (e.g., wires, LED indicators) are correctly applied. & The materials should appear as expected (correct wire colors, LEDs lit appropriately based on the state). & Materials were applied, but the wire colors were incorrect and did not match the expected design. LEDs lit appropriately based on the state. \\
5 & In the Scene view, locate and select the Smart Navigator model. & The Smart Navigator model should be clearly visible with proper shape, details, and texture. & The Smart Navigator model is clearly visible with proper shape, details, and texture. \\
6 & Compare the appearance of the Polemaster and Smart Navigator models to the reference photos. & The models should closely match the reference photos, with appropriate details, shapes, and colors. & Most of the models closely matched the reference photos, with appropriate details, shapes, and colors. Except for the wiring coloring. \\
